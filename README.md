# Genial game
Genial, a Simon-like game for Raspberry Pi written in Python.
## Introduction
Genial is a simple game written in Python and designed for Raspberry Pi. It is similar to [Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)), a popular electronic game during the 1980s, in which the player has to repeat the sequence of lights and sounds generated by the device. However, there are some differences between Genial and Simon: for example, Genial does not emit sound and does not repeat the same colour more than once in a row. If you would like to include these and other Simon features to the game, feel free to change the code and submit an issue with your suggestion after testing in your Raspberry Pi.
## Getting started

### Component list
- Raspberry Pi x1
- Breadboard x1
- Jumper wire male to male x9
- Jumper wire male to female x10
- LED x4 (red, blue, yellow and green)
- 220â„¦ (ohms) resistor x4
- Push button x5 (square buttons with colourful caps are preferable but not essential)

## Installing
### Repository
### GPIO Zero
If you are using Raspbian or the Raspberry Pi Desktop, GPIO Zero is installed by default. But if you are using Raspbian Lite or other operating system, click [here](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing.html) to install this library.
## How to play
The game starts at level 1, where one of the four LEDs turns on for one second. When it turns off again, the player has to push the button of the corresponding LED and then press the halt button at the end of the breadboard. If the player replicates the sequence correctly, all the LEDs will pulse and the player will pass to the next level, in which the computer will add another LED to the sequence. Otherwise, only the red LED will pulse and the player will have to repeat the level. To leave the game, press Ctrl + C.
