# Genial game
Genial, a Simon-like game for Raspberry Pi written in Python.
## Introduction
Genial is a simple game written in Python and designed for Raspberry Pi. It’s similar to [Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)), a popular electronic game during the 1980s, in which the player has to repeat the sequence of lights and sounds generated by the device. However, there are some differences between Genial and Simon: for example, Genial doesn’t emit sound and doesn’t repeat the same colour more than once in a row. If you would like to include these and other Simon features to the game, feel free to change the code and to commit your suggestion after testing in your Raspberry Pi.
